Assignment 1 Database Theory

Project Description:
This project reads a dataset then allows you to either: Insert a new item into the dataset,
Search for an item based on any attribute, Update an item based on the PARTKEY, or delete
an item based on the PARTKEY.

Downloading files:
Download the main.py and part.tbl files. These files should be located within the \downloads
section of the File Explorer on Windows and the Finder on Mac. These files should be in the
zip file together. 

How to Install and Run the Project:
Within the terminal create a new directory with the code "mkdir Assignment_1". Then 
"cd downloads" folder and move the main.py and part.tbl into the Assignment_1 directory.
From here "cd .." back to the original directory you started in. Then cd into the 
Assingment_1 directory and do "pip install pandas". This will allow you to properly 
run our python program. Then write "python main.py" which execute the code and you are
good to go!!

How to Use the Project:
The program will ask you to type a number based on which action you would like to complete
which will be to: Insert, Search, Update, or Delete. Depending on the selected action you 
will be prompted with new questions to continue along the proccess. The program will let
you know if you action was completed or if it failed to complete. After you complete the 
action, the code will prompt you again to pick another action. To quit, type -1 which will
close the program.
